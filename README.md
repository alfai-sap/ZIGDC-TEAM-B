In this world, the player must collect treasures and items that reveal fragments of the Biraddali story, leading him to the princess. Once the player reaches the princess, she offers her wings to him, allowing him to fly to the celestial kingdom where she came from. There, with the help of the princess's sisters, the player may find a way to return to his real world.
